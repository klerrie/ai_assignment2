    "user_question": "How does the payroll processing work?",
    "system_answer": "Payroll processing is automated and operates based on the company's pay schedule, which can be weekly, bi-weekly, semi-monthly, or monthly. The system calculates gross pay by considering hours worked, salary, overtime, bonuses, and commissions.

Once approved, direct deposits are initiated, and pay stubs are automatically generated and made available to employees.",
